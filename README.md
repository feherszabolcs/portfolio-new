# Personal portfolio - Made with React

To use it, first install npm plugins:
```
npm i 
npm run dev
```
- If you want to see it on your private network use `npm run dev -- --host`

- If you have errors when running `npm run dev` use the `-- force`switch after the command. There are some dependencie conflicts in the project.

I would like to make the page multilanguage, this is something that will come sometime.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
